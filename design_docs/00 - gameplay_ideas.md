# Gameplay Hook Ideas

 - I wonder if I could add multiplayer to my game. Or maybe asynchronous multiplayer, where you can see other players and chat but not interact. 
 >
- #### Maybe have a picture in picture little window in the corner with other player's recent deaths constantly running as they happen.
  - Because the levels are randomly generated, they couldn't be on the same map as you, but a little "other people's death cam"  sounds super fun 
  - I take snapshots of every step and turn anyway, so I can already rewind the game. That's how I do the visualization where it shows how the map is generated 
  >
  #### Just a little X-by-Y square popup in an unused corner of the interface whenever someone dies. 
  - This could work ludo-narratively, too, with the idea that your character is under the care of the Tower, which is basically omniscient
> I also had the idea that maybe you could use that omniscience as like a "precognition" where you get a running count of X turns that you can rewind, which slowly recharge after use
 Rewinding time and precognition are functionally the same in a video game, when you think about it.
