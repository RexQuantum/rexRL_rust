    I updated the Character heading in the center column to add The Tower as a character.
I imagine The Tower to be a Culture-style being like one of their Minds.
Curious and often bored, who doesn't need any of its inhabitants or the issues that they constantly face, 
but how else is it going to keep itself occupied? It's broken and stranded, itself

    A computer a hundred kilometers tall, reconfigurable, ostensibly into a ship if it wanted to. 
If it could, really. A higher-order being with a psychological crisis sounds interesting, 
especially if it's not going straight for the "killer computer/Harlan Ellison's
 I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream" route


But 
    "What happens when an all-knowing, all-seeing AI whose defining feature is its ability to repair or reconfigure itself in both 
of its vast material and intellectual/computational capacity... suddenly finds itself unable to?" is a good thesis, I think.

    There's no world ending threat, there's no explicit villain already built in here or anything.
 It's just a driving statement that can inform just about everything that you build in it
How do people live? Are there lots of societies? Are they stratified? 
do they trade? What about constructs? Non humans? AIs? Is it post-scarcity? 
Does The Tower do whatever it can to care for these people?
Why did it crack? Why couldn't it fix itself? Why wasn't the top section's consciousness
 still the same distributed personality as the rest of The Tower after the separation?
Ostensibly the tower is such a thing that it's one-in-all, like the trinity, you know? Separate and the same at the exact 
same time, so this shouldn't have happened.
