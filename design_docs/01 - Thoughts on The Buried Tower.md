I updated the Character heading in the center column to add The Tower as a character.

It's just a driving statement that can inform just about everything that you build in it

 I imagine **The Tower** to be a Banksian, Culture-style being like one of their Minds. Curious and often bored, who doesn't need any of its inhabitants or the issues that they constantly face, but how else is it going to keep itself occupied?

# **Questions That Should Be Answered**

> A list of questions that I feel should be answered when thinking about The Tower as a character and its background â€” some should only be answered for the author, others are things that the player should discover through exploration and gameplay.

* How do people live?
    *Are there many societies?
    *Are they stratified?
    *do they trade?
* What about constructs? Non humans? AIs?
* Is it post-scarcity?
* Does The Tower do whatever it can to care for these people?
* Why did it crack?
    *Why couldn't it repair itself?
    *Why didn't the top section's consciousness remain the same distributed personality as the rest of The Tower after the separation?
    *The nano machines that make up the tower's structure are work as a function of the _separate_ and the _whole_ of the AI so this theoretically _shouldn't_ have happened.
    *A computer a hundred kilometers tall, reconfigurable, ostensibly into a ship if it wanted to. If it could, really.
    *It's broken and stranded, itself. Is it by choice, by now?
